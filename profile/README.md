  <summary><h2>Using Helix with the template</h2></summary>

  Probably the most straight-forward way to use helix is to use the server template.
  
  1. Download the template from [Helix Server Template](https://github.com/HelixLoader/helix-template-server/releases) for your desired Minecraft version. The file is called `helix-server-template.zip`
  2. Place the downloaded .zip file in an empty folder, we reccomend using the [Helix Folder Structure](https://github.com/HelixLoader/helix-conventions/structure/folders.md)
  3. Extract the contents into the current folder, make sure to not extract into a new folder!
  4. If you are on windows, double-click on the `start-windows.bat` file. If you are on Linux or MacOS double-click or run the `start-unix` file.
  5. Follow the instructions in the newly opened window and enjoy!

  <summary><h2>Using Helix as an executable</h2></summary>

  If you prefer doing things manually, you can download the standalone JAR from the [Helix Standalone Releases](https://github.com/HelixLoader/helix-core/releases)
  
  You can double-click the `server.jar` file to run it, or alternatively it can be ran as follows:
  
  ```bash
  # Run the server without a GUI
  java -jar server.jar --nogui
  ```

# How can I help?
If you are a user, the best thing you can do is to spread the word! Talk about Helix with friends or in communities you are a part of, we'd greatly appreciate that!

If you are a developer, you can look at the [Helix Contribution Manual](https://github.com/HelixLoader/helix-conventions/contributing/manual.md) and see if there are any tasks you'd like to work on in our Projects tab.
